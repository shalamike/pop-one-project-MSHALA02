Project feedback and mark details

Correctness and adherence to specification:  30%  (out of 30%)
The game is correct and adheres to the specification.

Completeness of code, tests, and commit history:  30%    (out of 30%)   

Tests pass, are comprehensive enough, with suitable coverage for the scope of this work. Commit history is “healthy”. Code is also complete. 

Coding style: 10%   (out of 10%) 
Coding style is good.

Extension:  15%     (out of 30%) 
Extension was implemented but does not work properly. The save functionality also has some undesirable behaviour as can be seen from below:

to save game press 's' OR choose your move: s
game successfully saved
Illegal move--'S'

The game saves overwrites the previous one, it would be good to be given the option to save multiple files.

Finally a player is able to save their game playing as an M, and then load the game to play as an R. This behaviour is also considered a bug.
